# Lazy loading

Lazy loading options.

---

## `lazy`

- type: `boolean` or `LazyOptions`
- default: `false`

See also [Lazy-load translations](/guide/lazy-load-translations).

Whether the translations should be lazy-loaded. If this is enabled, you MUST configure the `langDir` option, and locales must be an array of objects, each containing a `file` or `files` key.

Loading locale messages lazily means that only messages for currently used locale (and for the fallback locale, if different from current locale) will be loaded on page loading.


## skipNuxtState

::alert{type="warning"}

🚧 This feature is not implemented yet.

The value can also be set to an object instead of the value `true` to override configuration options related to lazy loading. Supports the following optional properties:

- type: `boolean`
- default: `true`

Whether the translation messages for the current locale should be injected into Nuxt state and re-used on the client-side. [Read more](/guide/lazy-load-translations#lazy-configuration-options).

## `langDir`

- type: `string` or `null`
- default: `null`

A relative path to a directory containing translation files to load. Can be used with or without lazy-loading (the `lazy` option). 

The path is resolved relative to the project `srcDir` (project root by default).

::alert{type="warning"}
Absolute paths will fail in production (eg. `/locales` should be changed into either `locales` or `./locales`)
