# Layers

Nuxt i18n module supports layers and will automatically combine i18n configuration of all extended layers. [Read more about layers here](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/layers)

---

### Merging strategy
As described in the [Nuxt layer authoring guide](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/layers#multi-layer-support-for-nuxt-modules) 
> * Earlier items in the `_layers` array have higher priority and override later ones
> * The user's project is the first item in the `_layers` array

Mixing locale configuration such as lazy loading objects and strings may not work as expected, Nuxt i18n will attempt to merge layers as best it can. Consistency of i18n configuration between layers will be most effective.


### Pages & Routing

Pages in the `pages` directory from extended layers will automatically be merged and have i18n support as if they were part of your project. 

Page routes defined in `i18n.pages` in each layer configuration will be merged as well.

### Locales
::alert{type="warning"}
A project extending layers containing lazy-loaded translations is still required to have `lazy` and `langDir` options configured.
::

Extending your project with a layer that contains locales can be done as follows:

::code-group
  ::code-block{label="Project config" active}
  ```ts {} [nuxt.config.ts]
  export default defineNuxtConfig({
    extends: ['my-layer'],
    modules: ['@nuxtjs/i18n'],
    i18n: {
      lazy: true,
      langDir: './lang',
      locales: [{ code: 'en', file: 'en.json' }],
    },
  })
  ```
  ::
  ::code-block{label="Layer config"}
  ```ts
  export default defineNuxtConfig({
    modules: ['@nuxtjs/i18n'],
    i18n: {
      lazy: true,
      langDir: './lang',
      locales: [
        { code: 'en', file: 'en.json' },
        { code: 'nl', file: 'nl.json' },
      ],
    },
  })
  ```
  ::
::

This example would result in the project supporting two locales (`en`, `nl`) and would add the additional messages added for the `en` locale.

::code-group
  ::code-block{label="project/lang/en.json" active}
  ```ts {} [project/lang/en.json]
  {
    "title": "foo"
  }
  ```
  ::
  ::code-block{label="project/my-layer/lang/en.json"}
  ```ts {} [project/my-layer/lang/en.json]
  {
    "title": "layer title",
    "description": "bar"
  }
  ```
  ::
  ::code-block{label="result en.json"}
  ```ts {} [result]
  {
    // earlier layers take priority
    "title": "foo",
    "description": "bar"
  }
  ```
