## `compilation`

- type: `object`
- default: `{ jit: true, strictMessage: true, escapeHtml: false }`

Configure flags that sets the behavior compilation of locale messages.

Supported properties:

### `jit`

- type: `boolean`
- default: `true`

Whether to use the JIT compilation of Vue I18n message compiler.

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
Mean that necessary to pre-compile locale messages that are not managed by the nuxt i18n module (e.g. in the case of importing from a specific URL, you will need to precompile them yourself.)

And also, you need to understand that you cannot support use cases where you dynamically compose locale messages from the back-end via an API.
::

### `strictMessage`

- type: `boolean`
- default: `true`

Strictly check that the locale message does not contain HTML tags. If HTML tags are included, an error is thrown.

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
If you do not want the error to be thrown, you can work around it by setting it to false. However, **this means that the locale message might cause security issues with XSS**. In that case, we recommend setting the `escapeHtml` option to `true`.
::

### `escapeHtml`

- type: `boolean`
- default: `false`

Determine whether to escape HTML tags if they are included in the locale message.

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
If `strictMessage` is disabled by setting it to `false`, we recommend enabling this option.
