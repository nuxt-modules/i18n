**Nuxt i18n module** provides runtime hooks to perform specific tasks based on your app's language.

## Hooks

### `'i18n:beforeLocaleSwitch'`{lang="ts-type"}

Called before the app's locale is switched. Can be used to override the new locale by returning a new locale code.

Parameters:

- `oldLocale`
  - type: `string`{lang="ts-type"}
  - The app's locale before the switch

- `newLocale`
  - type: `string`{lang="ts-type"}
  - The app's locale after the switch

- `initialSetup`
  - type: `string`{lang="ts-type"}
  - Set to `true` if it's the initial locale switch that triggers on app load. It's a special case since the locale is not technically set yet so we're switching from no locale to locale.

- `context`
  - type: `NuxtApp`{lang="ts-type"}
  - The Nuxt app

Returns: `string | null`{lang="ts-type"}

### `'i18n:localeSwitched'`{lang="ts-type"}

Called right after the app's locale has been switched.

Parameters:

- `oldLocale`
  - type: `string`{lang="ts-type"}
  - The app's locale before the switch

- `newLocale`
  - type: `string`{lang="ts-type"}
  - The app's locale after the switch

## Usage

A typical usage would be to define those callbacks via a plugin where you can access the app's context \(useful if you need to change Axios' config when the language changes for example\).

```ts [/plugins/i18n.ts]
export default defineNuxtPlugin(nuxtApp => {
  // called right before setting a new locale
  nuxtApp.hook('i18n:beforeLocaleSwitch', ({ oldLocale, newLocale, initialSetup, context }) => {
    console.log('onBeforeLanguageSwitch', oldLocale, newLocale, initialSetup)
  })

  // called right after a new locale has been set
  nuxtApp.hook('i18n:localeSwitched', ({ oldLocale, newLocale }) => {
    console.log('onLanguageSwitched', oldLocale, newLocale)
  })
})
```
