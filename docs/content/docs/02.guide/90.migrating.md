### Upgrade to Vue I18n v11
We have upgrade from Vue I18n v10 to v11, this major version bump deprecates the Legacy API mode and custom `v-t` directive and drops `tc` and `$tc` from Legacy API mode.

Check the documentation detailing the breaking changes [here](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/migration/breaking11.html).

### Custom routes via `definePageMeta()`{lang="ts"}
We have added support for setting custom routes for pages using the `definePageMeta()`{lang="ts"} API, which is now the recommended way to set custom routes for pages.
This method is enabled by setting `customRoutes: 'meta'`{lang="ts"} in the module options.

To migrate from the `defineI18nRoute()`{lang="ts"} macro, you can simply replace it with `definePageMeta()`{lang="ts"} and set the `i18n` property with the same options:
```vue [pages/about.vue]
<script setup>
definePageMeta({
  i18n: {
    paths: {
      en: '/about-us',
      fr: '/a-propos',
    }
  }
})
</script>
```

### Experimental strict SEO mode
We have added a new experimental option `strictSeo`{lang="yml"} that enables strict SEO mode, which changes the way i18n head tags are handled. 

With strict SEO mode enabled, the i18n head tags are managed internally, this allows for some much requested improvements:
* The module will no longer add alternate tags for unsupported locales when setting localized dynamic route params.
* Unsupported locale links used with `<SwitchLocalePathLink>`{lang="vue"} are disabled, their links will be set to `'#'`{lang="ts"} and will have a `data-i18n-disabled`{lang="vue"} attribute for styling purposes.
* The `useLocaleHead()`{lang="ts"} is no longer needed in strict SEO mode, i18n tags are automatically set by the module and usage will throw an error.
* Canonical query parameters are configured globally with `experimental.strictSeo.canonicalQueryParams`{lang="yml"}.
* The `useSetI18nParams()`{lang="ts"} inherits the global canonical query parameter config which can be overridden through its options parameter.

If this mode proves stable it will become the default in v11, please try it out and report any issues you encounter.

### Lazy loading
The `lazy` option has been removed and lazy loading of locale messages is now the default behavior.

### Signature changed for `finalizePendingLocaleChange()`{lang="ts"}
The function signature for `finalizePendingLocaleChange()`{lang="ts"} has been corrected from `() => Promise<void>`{lang="ts-type"} to `() => void`{lang="ts-type"}.
This change was made since the function does not rely on any async operations and should not be awaited, and should prevent unnecessary function coloring.

### Arguments changed `useLocaleHead()`{lang="ts"} and `$localeHead()`{lang="ts"}
The `key` property has been removed and can no longer be configured, this is necessary for predictable and consistent localized head tag management.

### `restructureDir` migration path removed
To ease migration in v9 it was possible to disable the new directory structure by setting `restructureDir: false`, this has now been removed and we recommend using the default value of `'i18n'`.


### Removed options
The following options have been removed:

#### `bundle.optimizeTranslationDirective`{lang="yml"}
* This feature has been disabled and the option to enable it has been removed, see [the discussion in this issue](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/i18n/issues/3238#issuecomment-2672492536) for context on this change.

#### `experimental.generatedLocaleFilePathFormat`{lang="yml"}
* File paths (e.g. locale files, vue-i18n configs) configured for this module are now removed from the build entirely making this option obsolete.


### Deprecated options
The following options have been deprecated and will be removed in v11:

#### `types`{lang="yml"}
* Only `'composition'` types will be supported in v11, in line with Vue I18n v12.

#### `routesNameSeparator`{lang="yml"}
* This was documented as internal, use cases for end-users are unclear.

#### `defaultLocaleRouteNameSuffix`{lang="yml"}
* This was documented as internal, use cases for end-users are unclear.


### Promoted options
These options are stable and are now enabled by default, some have been renamed to better reflect their purpose. 

#### `experimental.hmr`{lang="yml"}
* Now configurable with the `hmr` option

#### `experimental.switchLocalePathLinkSSR`{lang="yml"}
* This is stable and the option to enable/disable it has been removed.

#### `experimental.autoImportTranslationFunctions`{lang="yml"}
* Now configurable with the `autoDeclare` option

### Dropped `$i18n`{lang="ts"} and `useI18n()`{lang="ts"} functions
The following i18n functions have been removed from the module, they were deprecated in v9.

#### `onLanguageSwitched()`{lang="ts"}
* This function actually called the hook instead of subscribing to it, leading to unpredictable behavior. Use the [`'i18n:languageSwitched'`{lang="ts"}](/docs/guide/runtime-hooks) hook instead.

#### `onBeforeLanguageSwitch()`{lang="ts"}
* This function actually called the hook instead of subscribing to it, leading to unpredictable behavior. Use the [`'i18n:beforeLanguageSwitch'`{lang="ts"}](/docs/guide/runtime-hooks) hook instead.


### Dropped context functions
The following functions have been removed from the Nuxt context.

#### `$resolveRoute()`{lang="ts"}
* Use `$localeRoute()`{lang="ts"} instead

#### `$localeLocation()`{lang="ts"}
* Use `$localeRoute()`{lang="ts"} instead


### Deprecated context functions
These Nuxt context functions have been deprecated and will be removed in v11. 

#### `$localeHead()`{lang="ts"}
* Deprecated due to limited use cases, the `useLocaleHead` composable offers the same functionality and is easier to use in combination with `useHead`.

#### `$getRouteBaseName()`{lang="ts"}
* Deprecated in favor of the same function under a new name: `$routeBaseName()`{lang="ts"}, to be consistent with the other context functions and their composable counterparts.


## Generated options
The generated options files in your projects are meant for internal use by this module at runtime and should never be used, more properties may be removed in the future.

The following exports have been removed from the generated options files (`#build/i18n.options.mjs` and `#internal/i18n/options.mjs`):
* `nuxtI18nOptions`
* `NUXT_I18N_MODULE_ID`
* `parallelPlugin`
* `isSSG`
* `hasPages`
* `DEFAULT_COOKIE_KEY`
* `DYNAMIC_PARAMS_KEY`
* `SWITCH_LOCALE_PATH_LINK_IDENTIFIER`

Reasons for removal: 
* These are no longer used by the module and might expose vulnerable information in the final build
* Some options are now used as static values for better tree-shaking resulting in a smaller project build.

## Runtime config
Several options set in the runtime config were only used to transfer build-time configuration to runtime and changing these at runtime could cause issues.

Instead of setting these on runtime config we now treat them as compiler constants, this way we can tree-shake any unused logic from a project build.

The following options have been removed from runtime config:
* `defaultDirection`
* `strategy`
  * You can access this on `useI18n()`{lang="ts"} or `$i18n`{lang="ts"}
* `lazy`
* `routeNameSeparator`
* `defaultLocaleRouteNameSuffix`
* `differentDomains`
* `multiDomainLocales`
  * Enabling this requires certain properties on locales at build-time, we do not see the use case for setting this at runtime.
* `trailingSlash`
