description: Nuxt i18n module overrides Nuxt default routes to add locale prefixes to every URL with routing strategies.

This feature is built on top of [Nuxt's routing](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/routing) which requires your project to have a `pages` directory for it to be enabled.

## Routing

**Nuxt i18n module** overrides Nuxt default routes to add locale prefixes to every URL (except in `'no_prefix'`{lang="ts-type"} strategy).

Say your app supports two languages: French and English as the default language, and you have the following pages in your project:

::code-group

```bash [Directory structure]
-| pages/
---| about.vue
---| index.vue
---| posts/
-----| [id].vue
```

```js [Generated routes (simplified)]
[
  {
    path: "/",
    name: "index___en",
  },
  {
    path: "/fr",
    name: "index___fr",
  },
  {
    path: "/about",
    name: "about___en",
  },
  {
    path: "/fr/about",
    name: "about___fr",
  },
  {
    path: "/posts/:id",
    name: "posts-id___en",
  },
  {
    path: "/fr/posts/:id",
    name: "posts-id___fr",
  }
]
```

::

Note that routes for the English version do not have any prefix because it is the default language, see the routing strategies section for more details.

## Strategies

There are 4 supported strategies that affect how app's routes are generated:

### `'no_prefix'`{lang="ts-type"}

With this strategy, your routes won't have a locale prefix added. The locale will be detected & changed without changing the URL. This implies that you have to rely on browser & cookie detection, and implement locale switches by calling the i18n API.

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
This strategy doesn't support [Custom paths](/docs/guide/custom-paths) and [Ignore routes](/docs/guide/ignoring-localized-routes) features unless you're also using [`differentDomains`](/docs/guide/different-domains).
::

### `'prefix_except_default'`{lang="ts-type"}

Using this strategy, all of your routes will have a locale prefix added except for the default language.

### `'prefix'`{lang="ts-type"}

With this strategy, all routes will have a locale prefix.

### `'prefix_and_default'`{lang="ts-type"}

This strategy combines both previous strategies behaviours, meaning that you will get URLs with prefixes for every language, but URLs for the default language will also have a non-prefixed version (though the prefixed version will be preferred when `detectBrowserLanguage` is enabled).

## Configuration

To configure the strategy, use the `strategy` option.
Make sure that you have a `defaultLocale` defined, especially if using `prefix_except_default`, `prefix_and_default` or `no_prefix` strategy. For other strategies it's also recommended to set this as it will be used as a fallback when attempting to redirect from a 404 page.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // ...

  i18n: {
    strategy: 'prefix_except_default',
    defaultLocale: 'en'
  }

  // ...
})
```

## Custom Locale Prefix

By default, locale codes are used as URL prefixes (e.g., `/en/about`, `/fr/about`). You can customize the URL prefix for each locale using the `prefix` property. This is useful when you want URLs that differ from your locale codes.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  i18n: {
    defaultLocale: 'en',
    locales: [
      { code: 'en', language: 'en-US' },
      { code: 'pt-BR', language: 'pt-BR', prefix: 'brazil' },
      { code: 'es-MX', language: 'es-MX', prefix: 'mexico' }
    ]
  }
})
```

With this configuration, your routes will look like:
- `/about` (English - default locale)
- `/brazil/about` (Brazilian Portuguese)
- `/mexico/about` (Mexican Spanish)

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
The locale `code` is still used internally for route names (e.g., `about___pt-BR`) and i18n functions. Only the URL path uses the custom prefix.
