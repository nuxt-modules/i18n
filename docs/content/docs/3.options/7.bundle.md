## `bundle`

- type: `object`
- default: `{ compositionOnly: true, runtimeOnly: false, fullInstall: true, dropMessageCompiler: false }`

Configure the bundling optimization for nuxt i18n module.

Supported properties:

### `compositionOnly`

- type: `boolean`
- default: `true`

Whether to make vue-i18n API only composition API. By default the legacy API is tree-shaken. For more details, See [here](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/advanced/optimization.html#reduce-bundle-size-with-feature-build-flags)

::alert{type="warning"}
If you would like to use Vue I18n's Legacy API, you must set `compositionOnly: false`. **Note that setting this value will disable Vue I18n Composition API**.

Note that the Legacy API can also be used in hybrid by setting the Vue I18n option to `allowComposition: true` in i18n.config, but this is limited. See [here](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/migration/vue3.html) for details.
::

### `runtimeOnly`

- type: `boolean`
- default: `false`

Whether or not to automatically use Vue I18n runtime-only in build.

::alert{type="warning"}
When you will enable this option, vue-i18n message compiler is not bundled. This means that you will not be able to dynamically retrieve locale messages for use in your application from back-end APIs via fetch, or programmatically compose the locale messages. That is to say, **you must be able to fully resolve locale messages at build time.**
::

### `fullInstall`

- type: `boolean`
- default: `true`

Whether to install the full set of APIs, components, etc. By default, all of them will be installed. If `false` is specified, built-in components (`i18n-t`, `i18n-d` and `i18n-n`) and directive (`v-t`) will not be installed in vue and will be tree-shaken. For more details, See [here](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/advanced/optimization.html#reduce-bundle-size-with-feature-build-flags)

### `dropMessageCompiler`

- type: `boolean`
- default: `false`

Whether to tree-shake message compiler when bundling.

::alert{type="info"}
If you use this option, you need to enable the `compilation.jit` option.
::

::alert{type="warning"}
If you enable this option, **you should check that resources in your application are pre-compiled with nuxt i18n module**. If you will be loading resources dynamically from the back-end via the API, enabling this option will not work because there is no message compiler.
::

### `onlyLocales`

- type: `string | string[]`
- default: `undefined`

Specify the locales codes that need to be included, the rest will be removed.

It can be useful if you have one code base (e.g. [Nuxt Layers](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/layers)) for several similar projects using different languages.

::alert{type="warning"}
The value of this **option will not be merged with other Nuxt Layers**. This option should only be specified in the final project config.
