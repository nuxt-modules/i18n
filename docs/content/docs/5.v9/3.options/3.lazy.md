## `lazy`

- type: `boolean` or `LazyOptions`
- default: `false`

See also [Lazy-load translations](/docs/guide/lazy-load-translations).

Whether the translations should be lazy-loaded. If this is enabled, you MUST configure the `langDir` option, and locales must be an array of objects, each containing a `file` or `files` key.

Loading locale messages lazily means that only messages for currently used locale (and for the fallback locale, if different from current locale) will be loaded on page loading.

## `langDir`

- type: `string` or `null`
- default: `null`

A relative path to a directory containing translation files to load. Can be used with or without lazy-loading (the `lazy` option).

The path is resolved relative to the project `srcDir` (project root by default).

Absolute paths will fail in production (eg. `/locales` should be changed into either `locales` or `./locales`)
