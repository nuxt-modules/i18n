## `compilation`

- type: `object`
- default: `{ strictMessage: true, escapeHtml: false }`

Configure flags that sets the behavior compilation of locale messages.

Supported properties:

### `strictMessage`

- type: `boolean`
- default: `true`

Strictly check that the locale message does not contain HTML tags. If HTML tags are included, an error is thrown.

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
If you do not want the error to be thrown, you can work around it by setting it to false. However, **this means that the locale message might cause security issues with XSS**. In that case, we recommend setting the `escapeHtml` option to `true`.

### `escapeHtml`

- type: `boolean`
- default: `false`

Determine whether to escape HTML tags if they are included in the locale message.

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
If `strictMessage` is disabled by setting it to `false`, we recommend enabling this option.
