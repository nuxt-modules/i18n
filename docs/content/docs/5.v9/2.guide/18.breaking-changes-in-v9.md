## Upgrade to Vue I18n v10

Vue I18n has been upgraded from v9 to v10. Vue I18n v10 has no major feature additions, but there are some disruptive changes, such as dropping some features that were deprecated in v9 and integrating the API `$tc` into `$t`, which can be used in the Legacy API style 

Check the documentation [here](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/migration/breaking10.html#change-t-and-t-overloaded-signature-for-legacy-api-mode) for more information.


## Drop `jit` option

JIT compilation is now the default in Vue I18n v10. 

https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/migration/breaking10.html#default-enable-for-jit-compilation

Accordingly, the `jit` option in Nuxt I18n v8 is no longer needed, so this option has been removed.


## Removal of deprecated `dynamicRouteParams` option and legacy dynamic route parameters implementation

Setting dynamic route parameters by setting the `nuxtI18n` property with `definePageMeta` has been fully removed in favor of the [`useSetI18nParams` composable](/docs/api#useseti18nparams), this feature is enabled by default which means the `dynamicRouteParams` option is no longer necessary.

The composable usage is similar to that of the deprecated implementation, see the migration example below:

```html
<script>
definePageMeta({
  nuxtI18n: {
    en: { id: 'my-post' },
    fr: { id: 'mon-article' }
  }
})
</script>
<template>
  <!-- pages/post/[id].vue -->
</template>
```

Should be changed to:

```html
<script>
const setI18nParams = useSetI18nParams();
setI18nParams({
	en: { id: 'my-post' },
	fr: { id: 'mon-article' }
})
</script>
<template>
  <!-- pages/post/[id].vue -->
</template>
```
