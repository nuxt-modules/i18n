## Upgrade to Vue I18n v10

Vue I18n has been upgraded from v9 to v10. Vue I18n v10 has no major feature additions, but there are some disruptive changes, such as dropping some features that were deprecated in v9 and integrating the API `$tc` into `$t`, which can be used in the Legacy API style 

Check the documentation [here](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/migration/breaking10.html#change-t-and-t-overloaded-signature-for-legacy-api-mode) for more information.


## Drop `jit` option

JIT compilation is now the default in Vue I18n v10. 

https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/migration/breaking10.html#default-enable-for-jit-compilation

Accordingly, the `jit` option in Nuxt I18n v8 is no longer needed, so this option has been removed.
