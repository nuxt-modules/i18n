title: useCookieLocale
---

The `useCookieLocale` composable returns the cookie locale.

<!-- ## Usage -->

If this composable function is called on client-side, it detects the locale from the value of `document.cookie` via `useCookie`. else on the server side, the locale is detected from the value of `cookie` header.

Note that if the value of `detectBrowserLanguage.useCookie` is `false`, an **empty string** is always returned.

## Type

```ts
declare function useCookieLocale(): Ref<string>
```
