**@nuxtjs/i18n** overrides Nuxt default routes to add locale prefixes to every URL (except in `no_prefix` strategy).
Say your app supports two languages: French and English as the default language, and you have the following pages in your project:

```
pages/
├── index.vue
├── about.vue
```

This would result in the following routes being generated

```json
[
  {
    path: '/',
    component: _3237362a,
    name: 'index___en'
  },
  {
    path: '/fr/',
    component: _3237362a,
    name: 'index___fr'
  },
  {
    path: '/about',
    component: _71a6ebb4,
    name: 'about___en'
  },
  {
    path: '/fr/about',
    component: _71a6ebb4,
    name: 'about___fr'
  }
]
```

Note that routes for the English version do not have any prefix because it is the default language, see [strategies](./strategies) for more details.
