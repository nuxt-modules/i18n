## `vueI18n`

- type: `object` or `string`
- default: `{}`

Configuration for the `vue-i18n` library that is used internally by this module. See full documentation at https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/api/general.html#createi18n

::alert{type="info"}

It's also supported to set this property to a path to a local configuration file. The file needs to export a function or plain object. If a function, it will be passed a Nuxt Context as a parameter. It's necessary to use that approach when overriding more complex types (like functions) that can't be stringified correctly.

```ts {}[~/vue-i18n.options.ts]
import type { I18nOptions } from 'vue-i18n'
import type { NuxtApp } from 'nuxt/dist/app/index'

export default function (nuxt: NuxtApp) {
  return {
    modifiers: {
      snakeCase: (str) => str.split(' ').join('-')
    }
  } as I18nOptions
}
```

::alert{type="warning"}

The `messages` option cannot be included in an object and exported with function due to limitations in Vue I18n v9 handling of locale messages.

As the workaround, you can use [lazy-load transtions](/guide/lazy-load-translations) in `@nuxtjs/i18n`. locale messages handled with lazy-load transtions will be loaded as locale messges inside Vue i18n.
