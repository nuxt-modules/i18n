## `differentDomains`

- type: `boolean`
- default: `false`

Set this to `true` when using different domains for each locale. If enabled, no prefix is added to your routes and you MUST configure locales as an array of objects, each containing a `domain` key. Refer to the [Different domains](/different-domains) for more information.
