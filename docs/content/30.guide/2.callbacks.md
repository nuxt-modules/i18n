**@nuxtjs/i18n** exposes some callbacks that you can use to perform specific tasks that depend on the app's language.

### `onBeforeLanguageSwitch`

Called before the app's locale is switched. Can be used to override the new locale by returning a new locale code.

Parameters:

- **oldLocale**: the app's locale before the switch
- **newLocale**: the app's locale after the switch
- **isInitialSetup**: set to `true` if it's the initial locale switch that triggers on app load. It's a special case since the locale is not technically set yet so we're switching from no locale to locale.
- **nuxtApp**: the Nuxt app

Returns: `string` or nothing

### `onLanguageSwitched`

Called right after the app's locale has been switched.

Parameters:

- **oldLocale**: the app's locale before the switch
- **newLocale**: the app's locale after the switch

## Usage

A typical usage would be to define those callbacks via a plugin where you can access the app's context \(useful if you need to change Axios' config when the language changes for example\).

```js {}[/plugins/i18n.js]
export default defineNuxtPlugin(nuxtApp => {
  // onBeforeLanguageSwitch called right before setting a new locale
  nuxtApp.$i18n.onBeforeLanguageSwitch = (oldLocale, newLocale, isInitialSetup, nuxtApp) => {
    console.log('onBeforeLanguageSwitch', oldLocale, newLocale, isInitialSetup)
  }
  // onLanguageSwitched called right after a new locale has been set
  nuxtApp.$i18n.onLanguageSwitched = (oldLocale, newLocale) => {
    console.log('onLanguageSwitched', oldLocale, newLocale)
  }
})
```
